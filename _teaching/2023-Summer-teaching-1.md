In this course, I have introduced some important academic journals in applied linguistics, the core parts of an academic paper in applied linguistics (i.e., introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion), the methods and tools used to organize your literature, some basic notions in corpus linguistics, and some ideas about how to select and publish your ideas in an international journal.

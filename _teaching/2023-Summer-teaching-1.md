In this course, I introduce important academic journals in applied linguistics, the core components of an academic paper in applied linguistics (i.e., introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion), the methods and tools used to organize your literature, some basic notions in corpus linguistics, and strategies for selecting and publishing your ideas in an international journal.

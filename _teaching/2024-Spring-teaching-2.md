This is a fundamental and threshold course for postgraduate students who are going to adopt R for research. In this course, I introduce the core workflow of data science for linguistic studies. Specifically, I cover the key functions in tidyverse to import/export data and perform data wrangling. Additionally, I demonstrate key functions in R packages that are especially useful for corpus studies, such as tidytext and quanteda. Furthermore, I explain the basic procedures for conducting a dictionary-based sentiment analysis step by step.

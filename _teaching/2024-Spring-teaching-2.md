This is a fundamental and threshold course  for postgraduate students who are going to adopt R for research. In this course, I have introduced the core workflow of data science for linguistic studies. Specifically, I introduced the key functions in tidyverse to import/export data and data wrangling. In addition, I have demonstrated the key functions in some R packages especially useful for corpus studies such as tidytext and quanteda. Furthermore,  I introduced the basic procedures for doing a dictionary-based sentiment analysis step by step.

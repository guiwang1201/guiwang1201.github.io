## Statement
I am currently a PhD candidate at Zhejiang University. My research focuses on corpus linguistics, computational semantic change, culturomics, and the intersections of language, culture, and history. I am hoping to find a postdoctoral position to promote my research ability further and establish a solid foundation for large scale text analysis and quantitative social science.

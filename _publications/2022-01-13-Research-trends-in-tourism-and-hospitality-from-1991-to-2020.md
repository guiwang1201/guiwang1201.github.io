**Abstract:** This study aims to track the historical development in tourism and hospitality research over the past 30 years by applying a novel interdisciplinary approach, combining both corpus linguistics and bibliometric analysis. Most frequently discussed topics and newly emerging topics were identified by investigating 18,266 abstracts from eighteen leading tourism and hospitality journals with corpus linguistics toolkit AntConc and natural language processing tool spaCy. Trend analysis and bibliometric methods were used to determine the longitudinal changes of research topics, most highly-cited publications, and authors’ production. This study revealed the evolution patterns of the identified 576 most frequently discussed topics across the four sub-periods (1991-2000, 2001-2010, 2011- 2015, 2016-2020). Specifically, results showed that information technology-related topics account for the largest proportion of the identified 38 newly emerging topics from 2011. Besides, researchers are increasingly focusing on the use of more sophisticated and advanced statistical methodologies. This study helps researchers make sensible decisions on what research topics to explore; it also helps practitioners and stakeholders make the shift and track opportunities in the field.

**Contribution:** Both Li Wang and Gui Wang conceptualized the study. Both Hui Wang and Gui Wang designed the methodology and wrote the initial draft of the manuscript. Both Hui Wang and Gui Wang involved in the data collection. Gui Wang was responsible for the primary statistical analysis. Hui Wang played a significant role in refining the study’s design, supervised the data collection process, and provided crucial feedback for data interpretation. Both Li Wang, Hui Wang and Gui Wang actively reviewed, revised, and contributed to the finalization of the manuscript. Li Wang provided constructive feedbacks on the finalization of the manuscript.

**Abstract:** This study intends to describe the diachronic changes of linguistic complexity (i.e. overall, morphological, and syntactic complexity) in scientific writing based on Kolmogorov complexity, an information-theoretic approach. We have chosen the entire data (i.e. all the 24 text types including articles, letters, news, etc.) and two individual registers (i.e. the full texts and abstracts of articles) of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific writing journal. The Mann-Kendall trend tests were used to capture diachronic changes in linguistic complexity at three complexity levels, and the Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the relationships between the three complexity metrics. Results showed that the overall and morphological complexity of both the entire data and full texts increased from 1821 to 1920, indicating a massive lexical expansion during this 100-year period, as evidenced by more and more word form variants in scientific writing. In contrast, the syntactic complexity of the entire data and full texts declined, suggesting a gradual shift towards grammatical simplification in the evolution of scientific writing, particularly in word order rules and syntactic patterns. A trade-off effect has also been found between syntactic and morphological complexity in the entire data. In addition, concerning abstracts, the overall and morphological complexity decreased while the syntactic complexity increased. Drawing from these results, researchers can better understand the changing linguistic complexity styles in scientific writing, thus making adjustments in their writing accordingly to garner greater attention in academia.

**Contribution:** Li Wang conceptualized the study. Gui Wang wrote the Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections. Hui Wang wrote the Methodology section. Nan Wang and Xinyi Sun wrote the Literature Review section. Both Gui Wang and Hui Wang were actively involved in the discussion of the Discussion section. Gui Wang outlined the workflow of the methodology and was responsible for the primary statistical analysis. Xinyi Sun was involved in the early data collection and organization. Hui Wang played a significant role in refining the study’s design. Li Wang, Hui Wang, and Gui Wang all actively reviewed, revised, and contributed to the finalization of the manuscript.

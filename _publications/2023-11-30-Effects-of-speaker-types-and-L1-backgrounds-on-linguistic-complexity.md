**Abstract:** This study investigated the differences in linguistic complexity between different types of English users, including native speakers (NS), English as a foreign language (EFL) learners, and English as a second language (ESL) learners in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. Furthermore, we explored how first language backgrounds affect linguistic complexity. Our dataset contains 2272 argumentative essays produced by English NSs and upper-intermediate learners from four ESL and six EFL countries/regions. Results showed that significant differences existed between the writings of NS, EFL, and ESL regarding overall and syntactic complexity. Specifically, the rank of overall complexity (NS > ESL > EFL) indicates that learners from countries/regions with higher exposure to English tend to produce overall more complex writings. Concerning syntactic complexity, EFL learners produce the most complex writings, while NS produces the least complex, indicating that essays written by EFL learners contain the most fixed word order patterns. In contrast, no significant difference was detected in morphological complexity among the NS, ESL, and EFL groups, suggesting that native and upper-intermediate non-NSs exhibit a similar range of morphological forms in their writings. Additionally, our results showed a larger effect of first language backgrounds over English speaker types on linguistic complexity, thus informing teachers to implement targeted writing instructions for learners from different countries.



**摘要：**本研究旨在深入探讨英语母语者 (Native Speakers, NS) 、英语作为外语的学习者 (English as a Foreign Language learners, EFL learners) 以及英语作为第二语言的学习者 (English as a Second Language learners, ESL learners) 在柯尔莫哥洛夫整体、句法及形态复杂度方面的差异性, 并进一步剖析学习者的母语背景对其语言复杂度的潜在影响。为此, 本文选取了2272篇来自英语母语者及四个ESL国家/地区和六个EFL国家/地区的中高级学习者所撰写的议论文文章进行深入分析。研究发现, 在整体和句法复杂度上, 三类英语使用者之间存在显著性差异。具体表现为, 整体复杂度方面, 英语母语者的输出超越了ESL和EFL学习者, 暗示英语接触频率可能与语言输出复杂度正相关。句法复杂度方面, EFL学习者的输出呈现出最高的句法复杂度, 而英语母语者则相对较低, 这可能与EFL学习者在写作中更为固定的词序模式有关。而在形态复杂度上, 三类英语使用者并未表现出显著差异, 暗示其在写作中所采用的词汇形态范围具有一致性。此外, 相较于英语使用者的类别, 学习者的母语背景对其语言复杂度的影响更为显著。鉴于此, 教育者在为不同母语背景的学习者提供写作指导时, 应充分考虑其母语背景的潜在影响, 以确保教学策略的针对性和实效性。
